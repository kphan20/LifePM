This project is meant to help me organize my life. I really enjoy the idea of loading up a backlog, but I often got paralyzed by choosing what to work on and it led me to just not doing the tasks. Therefore, I figured I would try to come up with a way to automatically choose what to work on, with a portal to continue adding backlog items and an automated notification to tell me what I should do that day. Here are the features I hope to support:

- Adding tasks with priorities, time estimates, and optional deadlines
- Recurring tasks with notification windows to give me a heads up
- Daily Telegram messages asking for time allowances for the day
- Web portal for entering tasks
- SQL data storage


Stretch goals:
- Categorization of tasks to encourage doing similar things (or maybe add variety)
- Create a page to view all tasks in the backlog
-- Make edits to tasks in the table
- consider adding priorities besides due dates


Useful Commands:
`python -m lifepm_flask` to run the flask application
